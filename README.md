# rosalind_protein_motif
Finds position of N-glycosylation motifs in proteins.

This code is a solution to the Finding a Protein Motif (ID - MPRT) problem on the bioinformatics website Rosalind.
It lists the positions where N-glycosylation motifs occur in protein amino acid sequences.

The program requires input of a text file containing a list of uniprot accession numbers to be checked for the motif 
and outputs the starting position of all N-glycosylation motifs for each ID.
